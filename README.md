# Block_Chain_Based_Certification_Authentication

E-certificate generation system which manually creates the certificates based on current students data by using blockchain  using a decentralized approach.
Our project will help to store the certificate in the block chain system and provide security. First ,the paper certificates are uploaded with student details and then using an algorithm a hash code value for the certificate is generated. Then the certificates are store in block chain. And these certificates are validated . By using block chain technology we can provide a more secure and efficient digital certificate validation.
